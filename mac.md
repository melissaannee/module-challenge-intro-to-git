## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!


1. What is Git? 

Git is  a distrubted version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among proggrammers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 

Git is a tool used to manage multiple versions of source code edits while GitHub serves as storage for uploaded copies of a Git repository.

3. Why do we create a branch? 

We create a branch to be able to immediately work directly on an issue from the issue page. 

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? 

Pull requestes allow you to inform collaborators of changes you have pushed to a branch and allows for discussion and adjustments before the code is merged to the main branch.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 

You can use the git checkout command written as "git checkout main" in this example.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 

"git fetch" is a command that is used to download contents from a remote repository. 
"git merge" is used to integrate changes or commits made in a branch with another branch to create a single branch with all updated changes. 
"git pull" is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository to ensure all content is the same and is the most updated version.

7. What is a merge conflict? 

Merge conflict is what happens when merging branches have competing or conflicting commits which causes Git to be unable to decide what commits to incorporate in the final merge.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? 

To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicting lines of code and decide what changes you would like to keep so that they are no longer competing commits.
